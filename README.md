This repository contains the week 1 task of project P2 - Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard using Power BI
The P2 - Sustainable Supply Chain Performance Dashboard using Power BI project is designed to provide actionable insights into supply chain metrics, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions that promote sustainability. Using Microsoft Power BI, data from various sources such as Excel and SQL Server is imported and prepared through the Power Query Editor, involving cleaning, transforming, and structuring processes. Multiple tables were created and organized, including the Inventory Table (tracking stock levels, product availability, lead times, and order quantities), the Manufacturing Table (monitoring production volumes, defect rates, and inspection results), the Supplier Table (detailing supplier locations, transportation modes, and lead times), and the comprehensive Supply Chain Table (combining key metrics like shipping costs, customer demographics, and supplier details). These tables were modeled and linked within Power BI to create a cohesive dataset.
